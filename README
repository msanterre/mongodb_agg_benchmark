In this project, I benchmark the different languages in for aggregation purposes. data_fill.py will fill up benchmark.doodas collection with a million documents containing 6 fields (a-f) with randomly generated numbers.

Approximate results from previous runs show the following times for 1 million documents:

C++     : 2.0s (Lacks sub-second precision)
Java    : 3.2s
Go      : 21.4s
Python  : 31.0s
Ruby	  : 42.7s
